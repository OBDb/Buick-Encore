    description: "The Buick Encore was a subcompact luxury crossover SUV based on the GM Gamma II platform shared with the Chevrolet Trax. As one of the first entries in the then-emerging subcompact luxury crossover segment, the Encore featured a tall profile with compact exterior dimensions, making it well-suited for urban environments. Powered by a 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine initially producing 138 HP (later increased to 153 HP in 2019), it was available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The interior emphasized premium features unusual for its size class, including active noise cancellation, a soft-touch dashboard, and available leather seating. A significant refresh in 2017 updated the exterior styling with a new winged grille design, revised headlights, and interior improvements including an updated infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The Encore helped establish Buick in a younger demographic and became one of the brand's best-selling models in the U.S. market before being effectively replaced by the larger Encore GX."
